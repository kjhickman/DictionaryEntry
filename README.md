# EntryKit

The goal is to bring Rust's "entry" API pattern to C# dictionaries, allowing for more elegant and ergonomic dictionary manipulations. This lightweight library provides extension methods that enable you to work with dictionary entries directly, eliminating repetitive key lookups and simplifying common operations like insert-or-update, insert-if-absent, and modify-in-place - all with clean, fluent syntax that feels natural in C#.
